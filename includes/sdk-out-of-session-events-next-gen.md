You can also track events as out-of-session. Out-of-session events have a `sessionId` of `-1` and aren't considered part of the current session, meaning they don't extend the current session. This might be useful if you are logging events triggered by push notifications, for example. You can mark events as out-of-session by setting the `EventOptions` `sessionId` to `-1` when calling `track(event, options)` or `identify(identify, options)`.
