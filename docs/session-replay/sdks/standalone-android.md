!!!note "Session Replay Instrumentation"
    Session Replay isn't enabled by default, and requires setup beyond the standard Amplitude instrumentation.
 
This article covers the installation of Session Replay for Android using the standalone SDK. If you use a provider other than Amplitude for in-product analytics, choose this option. If your site is already instrumented with Amplitude Android SDK, use the [Session Replay Android SDK Plugin](/session-replay/sdks/plugin-android).

## Before you begin

Use the latest version of the Session Replay Plugin above version `0.4.1`. For a list of available versions, see the [release versions](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.amplitude/session-replay-android/versions) on Maven Central.

Session Replay Standalone SDK requires that:

1. Your application is Android-based.
2. You track sessions with a timestamp, which you can pass to the SDK. You inform the SDK whenever a session timestamp changes.
3. You can provide a device ID to the SDK.
4. The `Session ID` and `Device ID` you pass to the Standalone SDK must match those sent as event properties to Amplitude.

The Standalone SDK doesn't provide Session management capabilities. Your application or a third-party integration must update the SDK with changes to `Session ID` and `Device ID`.

## Quickstart

Add the [latest version](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.amplitude/session-replay-android/versions) Session Replay SDK to your project dependencies.

=== "Gradle"

    ```kotlin
    implementation("com.amplitude:session-replay-android:0.4.+")
    ```

Configure your application code.

1. Create a  `val sessionReplay = SessionReplay()` object to begin collecting replays. Pass the API key, session identifier, and device identifier.
2. When the session identifier changes, pass the new value to Amplitude with `sessionReplay.setSessionId`.
3. Collect Session Replay properties to send with other event properties with `sessionReplay.getSessionReplayProperties`

```kotlin
import com.amplitude.android.sessionreplay.SessionReplay
import com.example.ThirdPartyAnalytics

// Initialize the standalone session replay SDK
val sessionReplay = SessionReplay(
    apiKey = "api-key",
    context = applicationContext,
    deviceId = "device-id",
    sessionId = Date().time,
    sampleRate = 1.0,
)

// Track an event
// Get session replay properties for this session
val sessionReplayProperties = sessionReplay.getSessionReplayProperties()
// Add session replay properties to the event before tracking
ThirdPartyAnalytics.track(
    eventName,
    if (eventProperties == null) sessionReplayProperties else eventProperties + sessionReplayProperties
)

// Handle session ID change
// Whenever the session ID changes
ThirdPartyAnalytics.setSessionId(sessionId)
// Update the session ID in session replay
sessionReplay.setSessionId(ThirdPartyAnalytics.getSessionId())
```

## Configuration

Pass the following configuration options when you initialize the Session Replay SDK.

| Name      | Type      | Required | Default         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------- |-----------| -------- |-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `deviceId` | `String`  | Yes      | `null`          | Sets an identifier for the device running your application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `sessionId` | `Long`    | Yes      | `null`          | Sets an identifier for the users current session. The value must be in milliseconds since epoch (Unix Timestamp).                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `sampleRate` | `Number`  | No       | `0.0`           | Use this option to control how many sessions to select for replay collection. <br></br>The number should be a decimal between 0 and 1, for example `0.4`, representing the fraction of sessions to have randomly selected for replay collection. Over a large number of sessions, `0.4` would select `40%` of those sessions. |
| `optOut`  | `Boolean` | No       | `false`         | Sets permission to collect replays for sessions. Setting a value of true prevents Amplitude from collecting session replays.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `logger`  | `Logger`  | No       | `LogcatLogger`  | Sets a custom `logger` class from the Logger to emit log messages to desired destination. Set to `null` to disable logging.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `serverZone` | `ServerZone`  | No       | `ServerZone.US` | `ServerZone.EU` or `ServerZone.US`. Sets the Amplitude server zone. Set this to EU for Amplitude projects created in EU data center.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### User opt-out

Session Replay provides an option for opt-out configuration. This prevents Amplitude from collecting session replays when passed as part of initialization. For example:

```kotlin
// Pass a boolean value to indicate a users opt-out status
val sessionReplay = SessionReplay(
    apiKey = API_KEY,
    optOpt = true,
    /* other session replay options */
)
```

--8<-- "includes/session-replay/eu-data-residency-common.md"

```kotlin
// Set serverZone to EU
val sessionReplay = SessionReplay(
    apiKey = API_KEY,
    serverZone = ServerZone.EU,
    /* other session replay options */
)
```

--8<-- "includes/session-replay/sampling-rate-common.md"

```kotlin
// This configuration samples 1% of all sessions
val sessionReplay = SessionReplay(
    apiKey = API_KEY,
    sampleRate = 0.01,
    /* other session replay options */
)
```

### Disable replay collection

Once enabled, Session Replay runs on your site until either:

- The user leaves your site
- You call `sessionReplay.shutdown()`

Call `sessionReplay.shutdown()` before a user navigates to a restricted area of your site to disable replay collection while the user is in that area. 

Create a new instance `sessionReplay = SessionReplay(apiKey = API_KEY, /* options */)` to re-enable replay collection when the return to an unrestricted area of your site.

You can also use a feature flag product like Amplitude Experiment to create logic that enables or disables replay collection based on criteria like location. For example, you can create a feature flag that targets a specific user group, and add that to your initialization logic:

```kotlin
import com.amplitude.android.sessionreplay.SessionReplay
import com.example.ThirdPartyAnalytics

val sessionReplay = SessionReplay(
    apiKey = API_KEY,
    deviceId = "device-id",
    sessionId = Date().time,
    sampleRate = 1.0,
    /* other session replay options */
)

if (nonEUCountryFlagEnabled) {
  val sessionReplayProperties = sessionReplay.getSessionReplayProperties()
  ThirdPartyAnalytics.track(
      eventName = 'event',
      eventProperties = eventProperties + sessionReplayProperties
  )
}
```

### Session replays don't appear in Amplitude 

Session replays may not appear in Amplitude due to:

- Lack of connectivity
- Failed to flush recording before exiting the app
- Sampling

#### Lack of connectivity

Ensure your app has access to the internet then try again.

#### Failed to flush recording before exiting the app

Session replay data is stored in memory only. This can lead to data loss between app starts.

Make sure to call `sessionReplay.flush()` to flush all pending session replay data before app exit.

Learn more in [Session Replay storage](#session-replay-storage).

#### Sampling

As mentioned above, the default `sampleRate` for Session Replay is `0`. Update the rate to a higher number. For more information see, [Sampling rate](#sampling-rate).

#### Some sessions don't include the Session Replay ID property

Session replay doesn't require that all events in a session have the `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID` property, only that one event in the session has it. Reasons why `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID`  may not be present in an event include:

- If you instrument an event with a source different from the source you connect to Session Replay. For example, your application may send events from a backend source, rather than the Browser SDK.
- If events fire when the user isn't focused on the page. Session Replay pauses the SDK when user focus leaves the page. Amplitude events may still send through your provider, but `getSessionReplayProperties()` doesn't return the `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID` property. This is because Session Replay hasn't begun the capture, since the user hasn't interacted with the page. This should lead to a decrease in the amount of inactivity that a replay captures.

### Session Replay processing errors

In general, replays should be available within minutes of ingestion. Delays or errors may be the result of one or more of the following:

- Mismatching API keys or Device IDs. This can happen if Session Replay and standard event instrumentation use different API keys or Device IDs.
- Session Replay references the wrong project.
- Short sessions. If a users bounces within a few seconds of initialization, the SDK may not have time to upload replay data.
- Page instrumentation. If Session Replay isn't implemented on all pages a user visits, their session may not capture properly.
- Replays older than the set [retention period](#retention-period) (defaults to 90 days).

*[alpha]: This product is in alpha. This feature be improved in future versions.
