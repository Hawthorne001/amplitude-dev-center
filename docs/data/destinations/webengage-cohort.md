## Considerations

- This integration is only available for customers who have paid plans with Amplitude.
- You must enable this integration in each Amplitude project you want to use it in.
- You need a paid WebEngage plan to enable this integration.
- Amplitude matches the `user_id` to the `CUID` in WebEngage to associate cohorts. If a user with a specific `user_id` doesn't exist in WebEngage, WebEngage doesn't create a user. Make sure that the Amplitude `user_id` field matches the WebEngage id field (`CUID`) to avoid user duplication.

## Setup

To configure the Cohort integration from Amplitude to WebEngage, complete the following steps in each platform.

### WebEngage 

In WebEngage, navigate to Data Platform > Integrations > REST API and copy the REST API key.

1. In Amplitude, open the cohort you want to sync, then click **Sync**.

### Use cases

Exporting user or behavioral-based Amplitude cohorts to WebEngage enables you to:

1. Drive retention-led growth by activating dormant customers, promoting repeat purchases, and driving platform engagement & content consumption. 
2. Engage cohort users with highly targeted & personalized messages through their preferred channel. Be it Push, In-app, SMS, Web Overlays, Web Push, Email, or WhatsApp.
